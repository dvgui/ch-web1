# CoderHouse web development project

Main branch is **master**, **devel** is for working process and there may be individual branches for specific features.
This is a small project for learning current methodologies for responsive web design, CSS and SASS.

## Topic

I used a bit of the content from XCAD Network for it, even though it is a very simple site and nothing like our production site.

> **Note**: I may be adding some nice functionalities as I progress throughout the course :)
